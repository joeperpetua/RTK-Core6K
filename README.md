# Optimized RTK-Core6K

This is a modification of the Japanese Optimized Core 6K deck (https://djtguide.neocities.org/anki.html) filtered and ordered by Remembering the Kanji 6th Edition (2200 kanji) lessons.

The deck contains subdecks for each lesson of the book, in each subdeck there are words of the Core 6K that contain the kanji seen on the lesson, this assuring you to learn vocabulary of which you know all the kanjis. 

Each entry is also tagged with its corresponding lesson so creating filtered decks for each lessons should be straight forward too.

The deck does not include the images that includes the Core 6K but it does include the original audio files.

All the words that did not contain any kanji were removed from the deck as well as the words that contained kanji not present on the Remembering the Kanji list.

You can check the files used for both RTK Kanji list and Core 6K words and the algorithm used to sort them out and add them using AnkiConenct in the deck Github repository: (https://github.com/joeperpetua/RTK-Core6K/)
